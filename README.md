# About Me ðŸ‘‹:
Hi, Iâ€™m Jaylen Bradley, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with a foundation in computer science, statistics, and full-stack development. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, a B.S. in Statistics, and an M.S. in Computer Science at Villanova Universityy, where I also conduct research in computer vision and deep learning using PyTorch. Iâ€™m especially interested in applying machine learning to areas like motion tracking, intelligent systems, and AI tooling that improves how people build and interact with technology.
